The GSQL Graph Algorithm test folder contains graph schema(s) and sample data
for testing the algorithms, including the tiny graph(s) used in the
documentation to illustrate the meaning of each algorithm.

1) Run the following command in a Linux shell on your TigerGraph machine:
  bash create_alg_graph.sh

2) Select a graph schema.
   The existing graph data will be dropped and the new schema will be created.
   This may take 1 or 2 minutes.

3) Select a data file.
   Most of the data files are very small, so they will load quickly.

Folder Organization

  README.test		This file

  create_alg_graph.sh - bash script to create a graph and load data into it.
			The script will ask the user which graph schema to create
			and which data set to load.
 
  generic/		a graph folder

  social/		another graph folder, weighted graph

  movie/                another graph folder, weighted graph

  generic, social and movie are the names of graph schemas used for examples.
  Each graph folder contains the follwing:

	schema_<graph>.gsql	GSQL command file to create the graph schema

	load_<graph>.gsql	GSQL command file to define a load job and to

				load the selected data file
	data/			folder containing one or more data files
				to load into the graph.

Note: The generic and social graph schemas have been extended so that they now
have *equivalent* topologies, meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence
between their entity types and attributes:
		 Social        Generic    
vertex           Person        Node       
directed edge    Friend        LinkTo      
  its rev edge   Also_Friend   LinkFrom    
undirected edge  Coworker      Link

This means that the data sets for either schema can be loaded into either graph.

Movie graph is for similarity algorithms:
                 Movie
vertex           Person        
subject vetex    Movie
directed edge    Likes
  its rev edge   reverse_Likes   
undirected edge  similarity
